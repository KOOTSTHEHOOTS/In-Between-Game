# In-Between-Game
My first repository. An attempt by a newbie programmer at making the game In-between. Not even sure if I should include the all my files here haha

How the game works

- A game using poker cards
- No jokers
- suits does not matter, only the value of the card
- every player gets two cards which serve as boundaries
- a player can choose to bet money and draw a third card

If the third card
Is in-between the boundaries: Take the amount of money they bet from the pot
Is outside the boundaries: Lose the amount of money they bet
On the boundary: Pay double the amount of money bet.


Planned
- Counter to track money
- More than one player(currently single player)
- Optional statistics counter to show expectated % of each situation
- Card images rather than text
- Animation for drawing cards from a deck
- Animation for shuffling cards in deck
- starting screen
